# Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing Suite Implementation Details

## Context & Overview

The architectural improvements introduce significant complexity that requires comprehensive testing to ensure reliability, performance, and correctness. The current testing is minimal and doesn't cover the new async operations, multi-client scenarios, or failure conditions.

**Current Testing Gaps:**
- Limited unit test coverage (basic connection tests only)
- No integration tests for async operations
- Missing load testing for concurrent scenarios
- No chaos engineering or failure simulation
- Insufficient performance regression testing
- No end-to-end testing with real MCP clients

**Target Architecture:**
- Comprehensive unit tests with >95% coverage
- Integration tests for all async operations and workflows
- Load testing with realistic concurrent scenarios
- Chaos engineering tests for resilience validation
- Automated regression testing with performance baselines
- End-to-end testing with multiple MCP client types

## Dependencies Required

Add to `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
testing = [
    "pytest>=7.4.0",            # Already present
    "pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0",   # Async test support
    "pytest-cov>=4.1.0",        # Coverage reporting
    "pytest-xdist>=3.3.0",      # Parallel test execution
    "pytest-benchmark>=4.0.0",   # Performance benchmarking
    "httpx>=0.25.0",            # HTTP client for testing
    "websockets>=12.0",         # WebSocket testing
    "locust>=2.17.0",           # Load testing framework
    "factory-boy>=3.3.0",       # Test data factories
    "freezegun>=1.2.0",         # Time manipulation for tests
    "responses>=0.23.0",        # HTTP request mocking
    "pytest-mock>=3.11.0",      # Enhanced mocking
]

chaos_testing = [
    "chaos-toolkit>=1.15.0",    # Chaos engineering
    "toxiproxy-python>=0.1.0",  # Network failure simulation
]
```

## Implementation Plan

### 3. Chaos Engineering Tests {#chaos-testing}

**Step 1: Chaos Testing Framework**

Create `tests/chaos/test_resilience.py`:

```python
"""Chaos engineering tests for system resilience."""

import pytest
import asyncio
import random
import time
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock


class ChaosTestFramework:
    """Framework for chaos engineering tests."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_chaos = []
    
    @asynccontextmanager
    async def network_partition(self, duration: float = 5.0):
        """Simulate network partition."""
