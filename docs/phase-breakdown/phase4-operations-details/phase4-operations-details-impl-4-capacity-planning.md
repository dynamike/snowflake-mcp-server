# Phase 4: Operations Documentation Implementation Details

## Context & Overview

The new multi-client, async, daemon-capable architecture requires comprehensive operational procedures to ensure reliable production deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. This differs significantly from the simple stdio process management of v0.2.0.

**Operational Challenges:**
- Complex daemon lifecycle management vs simple stdio process
- Connection pool health monitoring and maintenance
- Multi-client session tracking and troubleshooting
- Performance monitoring across concurrent workloads
- Scaling decisions based on usage patterns and capacity metrics

**Target Operations:**
- Comprehensive runbook for all operational procedures
- Automated monitoring setup with alerting
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Scaling guidelines based on usage patterns
- Capacity planning tools and recommendations

## Implementation Plan

Create comprehensive capacity planning tools and recommendations for forecasting resource needs and scaling decisions...

## Dependencies Required

Add to `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
operations = [
    "psutil>=5.9.0",           # System monitoring
    "prometheus-client>=0.17.0", # Metrics client
    "grafana-api>=1.0.3",      # Grafana API client
    "paramiko>=3.3.0",         # SSH for remote operations
    "fabric>=3.2.0",           # Deployment automation
    "ansible>=8.0.0",          # Configuration management
]
```

This operations documentation provides comprehensive procedures for managing the new architecture in production environments with proper monitoring, backup, and recovery capabilities.
