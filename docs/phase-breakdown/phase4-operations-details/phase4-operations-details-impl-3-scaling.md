# Phase 4: Operations Documentation Implementation Details

## Context & Overview

The new multi-client, async, daemon-capable architecture requires comprehensive operational procedures to ensure reliable production deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. This differs significantly from the simple stdio process management of v0.2.0.

**Operational Challenges:**
- Complex daemon lifecycle management vs simple stdio process
- Connection pool health monitoring and maintenance
- Multi-client session tracking and troubleshooting
- Performance monitoring across concurrent workloads
- Scaling decisions based on usage patterns and capacity metrics

**Target Operations:**
- Comprehensive runbook for all operational procedures
- Automated monitoring setup with alerting
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Scaling guidelines based on usage patterns
- Capacity planning tools and recommendations
