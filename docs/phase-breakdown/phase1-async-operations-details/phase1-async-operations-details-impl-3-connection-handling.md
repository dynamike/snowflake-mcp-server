# Phase 1: Async Operations Implementation Details

## Context & Overview

The current Snowflake MCP server in `snowflake_mcp_server/main.py` uses blocking synchronous database operations within async handler functions. This creates a performance bottleneck where each database call blocks the entire event loop, preventing true concurrent request processing.

**Current Issues:**
- `conn.cursor().execute()` calls are synchronous and block the event loop
- Multiple concurrent MCP requests queue up waiting for database operations
- Async/await keywords are used but don't provide actual concurrency benefits
- Thread pool executor not utilized for blocking I/O operations

**Target Architecture:**
- True async database operations using thread pool executors
- Non-blocking cursor management with proper resource cleanup
- Async context managers for connection acquisition/release
- Error handling optimized for async contexts

## Current State Analysis

### Problematic Patterns in `main.py`

Lines 91-120 in `handle_list_databases`:
```python
# BLOCKING: This blocks the event loop
conn = connection_manager.get_connection()
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SHOW DATABASES")  # Blocks until complete

# BLOCKING: Synchronous result processing
for row in cursor:
    databases.append(row[1])
```

Lines 164-174 in `handle_list_views`:
```python
# BLOCKING: Multiple synchronous execute calls
cursor.execute(f"SHOW VIEWS IN {database}.{schema}")
for row in cursor:
    view_name = row[1]
    # ... more blocking processing
```

## Implementation Plan

### 3. Connection Handling Updates {#connection-handling}

**Update Connection Context Manager**

Modify `async_pool.py`:

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def get_async_database_ops():
    """Enhanced context manager with proper cleanup."""
    pool = await get_connection_pool()
    async with pool.acquire() as connection:
        db_ops = AsyncDatabaseOperations(connection)
        try:
            yield db_ops
        finally:
            # Ensure cleanup happens even on exceptions
            await db_ops.cleanup()
```
